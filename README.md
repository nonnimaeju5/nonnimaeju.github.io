# Javascript - Functions Guide

## I followed the theme guide from the Functions project and aimed to fill out all sections that we were asked to do. 
### There was alot of reading about Functions both online and from a Javascript book by Jon Duckett. Watched youtube videos and tryed to prepare this assignment well before i started coding. 
### After i started coding i also of course used Google and used Sm√°ri's videos to get me started.
