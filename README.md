# Javascript - Functions Guide
--
## I followed the theme guide from the Functions project, and used Sm√°ri's videos to get me started.
### I also read alot about Functions both online and from a Javascript book by Jon Duckett. Watched youtube videos and tryed to prepare this assignment well before i started coding.
